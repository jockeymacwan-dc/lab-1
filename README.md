This simple Python script demonstrates basic arithmetic operations: addition and multiplication. It defines two functions, `add_numbers` and `multiply_numbers`, to perform these operations on two given numbers. The script then uses these functions to calculate the sum and product of two predefined numbers and prints the results.

The script serves as an easy-to-understand example for beginners learning Python, showcasing how to define functions, perform basic arithmetic, and print outputs. It is a useful starting point for anyone looking to get familiar with fundamental programming concepts in Python.
